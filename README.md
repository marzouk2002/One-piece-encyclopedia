# One-piece-encyclopedia

I've only created this repository so I can link to one place to my project. The parts of it are [the application interface](https://github.com/marzouk2002/One-piece-interface) and [the Rest API](https://github.com/marzouk2002/one-piece-api).<br/>
the first is built using React and styled using Boostrap. And the second uses MongoDB as a database and is built with NodeJs (Express).
